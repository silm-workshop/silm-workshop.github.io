<h3>Special Theme 2023: SILM for Telecommunications</h3>

<p>
As a special theme for SILM 2023, we solicit submissions that present novel
research that develops or relies on hardware/software interfaces to improve
security and dependability in the telecommunications sector. In particular,
work that aims at 5G, edge and cloud scenarios where strict requirements on
bandwidth, latency, and availability need to be met, are of special
interest for SILM this year. Submissions must be within the general scope
of SILM 2023 as stated above.
</p>

<h3>General topics of interest</h3>

<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following:
<ul> 
    <li>Hardware reverse engineering</li>
    <li>Microcode security analyses</li>
    <li>Software side-channel attacks</li>
    <li>Software attacks against micr-architecture</li>
    <li>Software-activated fault attacks</li>
    <li>Hardware-based security mechanisms</li>
    <li>Software counter-measures against hardware vulnerabilities</li>
    <li>Formal methods applied to the security of software/hardware interfaces</li>
    <li>Hardware enclaves</li>
    <li>Hardware trace mechanisms for security</li>
    <li>OS and VM introspection</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>Submission guidelines</h3>

<p>We accept two categories of submissions:
<ol>
    <li>Regular papers describing fully developed work and complete results (10 pages, references included, IEEE format)</li>
    <li>Short papers, position papers, industry experience reports, work-in-
    progress submissions and ideas (6 pages, references included, IEEE format;
    work-in-progress and idea submissions should clearly outline research
    hypothesis, evaluation strategy and potential impact)</li>
</ol>

<p>All papers must be written in English and describe original work that
has not been published or submitted elsewhere. The submission category
(regular paper, short paper, special theme) should be clearly indicated.
All submissions will be fully reviewed by members of the Program Committee.
Papers will appear in IEEE Xplore in a companion volume to the regular
EuroS&amp;P proceedings. Contact the Program Chairs if you do *not* want
your *short paper* to appear in the proceedings.</p>

<p>Papers must be typeset in LaTeX in A4 format (not “US Letter”) using the
IEEE conference proceeding template we provide: <a
href="https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/EuroSP2023/eurosp2023-template.zip">eurosp-2023-template.zip</a>
We suggest you first compile the supplied LaTeX source as is, checking that
you obtain the same PDF as the one supplied, and then write your paper into
the LaTeX template, replacing the boilerplate text. Please do not use other
IEEE templates. Failure to adhere to the page limit and formatting
requirements can be grounds for rejection.</p>

<p>For accepted papers, at least one author must attend the workshop.</p>
