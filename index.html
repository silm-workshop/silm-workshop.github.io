<p> Welcome to the 5th edition of our workshop on the *Security of Software
/ Hardware Interfaces.* #SILM2023 will take place on <b>Monday, July 03
2023, in Delft (The Netherlands),</b> co-located with the <a
href="https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/EuroSP2023/">8th IEEE European
Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&amp;P 2023)</a></p>

<h3>Submissions</h3>

<p>Submission deadline is <b>March 02, 2023 -- 11:59pm AoE</b>; check
our <a href="https://silm-workshop.github.io/cfp">Call for Papers</a> for
details.</p>

<h3>Aim and Scope</h3>

<p>
It is becoming increasingly important to combine software and hardware
aspects to take new software attacks into account. For example, hardware
vulnerabilities such as Spectre or Meltdown can be exploited purely by
software attacks. Such attacks can be executed remotely and do not require
physical access to the targeted hardware platform. On the other hand,
hardware features can be used to better detect and respond to traditional
software attacks, such as memory corruption. Therefore, it is necessary to
study the security of software/hardware interfaces, both in terms of
attacks and defences.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of the SILM workshop is to share experiences, tools, and
methodologies to handle security in software/hardware interfaces. On the
one hand, we need to better assess the security guarantees provided by
existing hardware architectures against software attacks, especially
attacks against micro-architecture. This can be achieved by identifying new
vulnerabilities using reverse engineering, fuzzing, or other attack
approaches. On the other hand, we also need to propose new architectures
offering better resilience against software attacks. These architectures
should rely on hardware-based security mechanisms to protect the software
stack. One of the challenges is to formally specify and verify the security
guarantees offered by such architectures.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this 5th edition of the SILM workshop is to provide a forum
for researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government
that work on the security of software/hardware interfaces.
