<p> Welcome to the 4th edition of our workshop on the Security of Software
/ Hardware Interfaces. SILM 2022 will take place on <b>Monday, June 06 2022,
in Genoa (Italy),</b> co-located with the <a href="https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/EuroSP2022/">7th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P 2022)</a></p>

<h3>Submissions</h3>

<p>Submission deadline is <b>March 18, 2022 â€“ 11:59pm AoE</b>; check
our <a href="https://silm-workshop.github.io/cfp">Call for Papers</a> for
details.</p>

<p><b>We are unlikely to offer a general extension of the submission deadline
this year. Please get in touch with the PC chairs at <a
href="mailto:silm-workshop@inria.fr">silm-workshop@inria.fr</a> if a short
individual extension would help you to prepare your submission.</b></p>

<h3>Aim and Scope</h3>

<p>It is becoming increasingly important to combine software and hardware aspects to take new software attacks into account. For example, hardware vulnerabilities such as Spectre or Meltdown can be exploited by purely software attacks. Such attacks can be executed remotely and do not require physical access to the targeted hardware platform. On the other hand, hardware features can be used to better detect and respond to traditional software attacks, such as memory corruption. Therefore, it is necessary to study the security of software/hardware interfaces, both in terms of attacks and defenses.</p>

<p>The purpose of the SILM workshop is to share experiences, tools, and methodologies to handle security in software/hardware interfaces. On the one hand, we need to better assess the security guarantees provided by existing hardware architectures against software attacks, especially attacks against micro-architecture. This can be achieved by identifying new vulnerabilities using reverse engineering, fuzzing, or other attack approaches. On the other hand, we also need to propose new architectures offering better resilience against software attacks. These architectures should rely on hardware-based security mechanisms to protect the software stack. One of the challenges is formally specifying and verifying the security guarantees offered by such architectures.</p>

<p>The goal of this third edition of the SILM workshop is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government that work on the security of software/hardware interfaces.</p>
