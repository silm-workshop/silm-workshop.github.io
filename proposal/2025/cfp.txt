            H3S Workshop on Hardware-Supported Software Security
               Thursday, September 25 2025, Toulouse (France)

******************************************************************************

Combining software and hardware aspects to consider new software attacks 
is becoming increasingly important. For example, hardware vulnerabilities
 such as Spectre or Meltdown can be exploited purely by software attacks. 
Such attacks can be executed remotely and do not require physical access 
to the targeted hardware platform. On the other hand, hardware features 
can be used to better detect and respond to traditional software attacks, 
such as memory corruption. Therefore, it is necessary to study the security 
of software/hardware interfaces, both in terms of attacks and defences.

The H3S workshop aims to share experiences, tools, and methodologies to handle 
security in software/hardware interfaces. On the
one hand, we need to assess better the security guarantees provided by
existing hardware architectures against software attacks, especially
attacks against micro-architecture. This can be achieved by identifying new
vulnerabilities using reverse engineering, fuzzing, or other attack
approaches. On the other hand, we also need to propose new architectures
offering better resilience against software attacks. These architectures
should rely on hardware-based security mechanisms to protect the software
stack. One of the challenges is to formally specify and verify the security
guarantees offered by such architectures.

The goal of this 6th edition of the SILM workshop is to provide a forum
for researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government
that work on the security of software/hardware interfaces.

==== Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following

 * Hardware reverse engineering
 * Microcode security analyses
 * Software side-channel attacks
 * Software attacks against micro-architecture
 * Software-activated fault attacks
 * Hardware-based security mechanisms
 * Software counter-measures against hardware vulnerabilities
 * Formal methods applied to the security of software/hardware interfaces
 * Hardware enclaves
 * Hardware trace mechanisms for security
 * OS and VM introspection

==== Important Dates

 - Submission: March 08, 2024 -- 11:59pm AoE May 21, 2025
 - Author Notification: April 30, 2024 June 15, 2025
 - Camera Ready Version: May 14, 2024 June 27, 2025
 - Workshop: July 12, 2024 September 25, 2025

==== Submission and Publication

There are two categories of submissions:

 1. Regular papers describing fully developed work and complete results (20
    pages, references included, LNCS format)

 2. Short papers, position papers, industry experience reports, work-in-
    progress submissions and ideas (10 pages, references included, IEEE format;
    work-in-progress and idea submissions should clearly outline the research
    hypothesis, evaluation strategy and potential impact)

All papers must be written in English and describe original work that has
not been published or submitted elsewhere. The submission category (regular
paper, short paper, special theme) should be clearly indicated. Members of the 
The Program Committee will fully review all submissions.
Papers will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(LNCS) series. Contact the Program Chairs if you do not want your
*short paper* to appear in the proceedings.

Papers must be typeset in LaTeX using the LNCS template available at :
https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines. 
Failure to adhere to the page limit and formatting
requirements can be grounds for rejection.

For accepted papers, at least one author must attend the workshop.
