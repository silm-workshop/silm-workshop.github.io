            HS3 Workshop on Hardware-Supported Software Security

******************************************************************************

Combining software and hardware aspects to consider new software attacks 
is becoming increasingly important. For example, hardware vulnerabilities
 such as Spectre or Meltdown can be exploited purely by software attacks. 
Such attacks can be executed remotely and do not require physical access 
to the targeted hardware platform. On the other hand, hardware features 
can be used to better detect and respond to traditional software attacks, 
such as memory corruption. Therefore, it is necessary to study the security 
of software/hardware interfaces in terms of attacks and defences.


The purpose of the HS3 workshop is to share experience, tools and 
methodology on hardware-assisted software security. On one hand, we need 
to propose new architectures offering better resilience against software 
attacks. These architectures should rely on hardware-based security 
mechanisms to protect the software stack. One of the challenges is to 
formally specify and verify the security guarantees offered by such 
architectures. On the other hand, we also need to assess better the 
security guarantees provided by existing hardware architectures against 
software attacks, especially attacks against micro-architecture. This can 
be achieved by identifying new vulnerabilities using reverse engineering, 
fuzzing or other attack approaches. 

The goal of this HS3 workshop is to provide a forum for researchers and 
practitioners from academia, industry and government who work on 
hardware-assisted software security.


==== Topics of interest include, but are not limited, to the following

 * Hardware-based security mechanisms
 * Hardware-assisted intrusion detection and reaction
 * Hardware enclaves
 * Security co-processors
 * Leveraging hardware features at the software level (e.g. compiler, OS) for security
 * Hardware/software contracts for security
 * Formal methods applied to the hardware-assisted security
 * Hardware trace mechanisms for security
 * OS and VM introspection
 * Software side-channel attacks
 * Software attacks against micro-architecture
 * Software-activated fault attacks


==== Important Dates

 - Submission: May 21, 2025 -- 11:59pm AoE 
 - Author Notification: June 15, 2025
 - Camera Ready Version: June 27, 2025
 - Workshop: September 25, 2025

==== Submission and Publication

There are two categories of submissions:

 1. Regular papers describing fully developed work and complete results (20
    pages, references included, LNCS format)

 2. Short papers, position papers, industry experience reports, work-in-
    progress submissions and ideas (10 pages, references included, LNCS format;
    work-in-progress and idea submissions should clearly outline the research
    hypothesis, evaluation strategy and potential impact)

All papers must be written in English and describe original work that has
not been published or submitted elsewhere. The submission category (regular
paper, short paper, special theme) should be clearly indicated. Members of the 
The Program Committee will fully review all submissions.
Papers will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(LNCS) series. Contact the Program Chairs if you do not want your
*short paper* to appear in the proceedings.

Papers must be typeset in LaTeX using the LNCS template available at :
https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines. 
Failure to adhere to the page limit and formatting requirements can be grounds 
for rejection.

For accepted papers, at least one author must attend the workshop.
