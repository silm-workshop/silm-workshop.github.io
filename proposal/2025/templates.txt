Dear [*FIRST-NAME*],

We are happy to inform you that your submission

[*PAPER-ID*], [*TITLE*]

was accepted for SILM2022. Please find the reviewers' comments on your
paper with this email. On behalf of the Program Committee, we would like to
thank you very much for your submission and support to SILM.

*Camera-Ready Submission*
As you chose to *not have your paper published* with the EuroS&P
proceedings, we will only put your final paper on the SILM 2022 programme
web site. For this, please prepare your camera-ready version *by
2022-04-22* and send us the final PDF (or a link to your paper on
arxiv.org) by email to silm-workshop@inria.fr. There is no hard page limit for
this, so feel free to add additional material to address the reviewers'
comments as you see fit.

*Conference Registration*
We expect that at least one author of each accepted paper will attend
EuroS&P. Registrations can be made via the conference website:
https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/EuroSP2022/

Best regards,
Jan Tobias & Guillaume
