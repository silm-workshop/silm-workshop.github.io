### Sergej Proskurin: Virtualization-assisted Operating System Security

**Abstract:** Virtualization technology has undergone a paradigm shift,
with a renewed focus on system security. This shift inspired researches to
repurpose modern virtualization extensions to form novel
virtualization-assisted primitives for dynamic binary analysis and
operating system security. This talk explores the potential of
virtualization technology for system security and how we can alleviate the
strict separation between operating systems and virtual machine monitors to
empower systems with advanced security primitives. 

**Speaker:** Sergej Proskurin works as a Senior Security Engineer at
BedRock Systems, specializing in virtualization-assisted operating system
security. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Technical
University of Munich. His research interests cover a wide range of
low-level topics. In particular, he is passionate about operating system
design and leveraging virtualization technology for dynamic binary analysis
and operating system security. In the past, Sergej actively contributed to
open source projects, including the Xen Project hypervisor and the
black-box binary analysis system DRAKVUF.
