<h3 id="bugsbunny">BugsBunny: Hopping to RTL Targets with a Directed
Hardware-Design</h3>

<b>Authors:</b> Hany Ragab, Koen Koning, Cristiano Giuffrida and Herbert
Bos <br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b> Recent attacks on modern processors have demonstrated the
severe consequences of discovering and exploiting hardware vulnerabilities.
Simultaneously, the increasing complexity of modern chip designs and the
ever-limited testing time presents numerous challenges to existing
pre-silicon hardware-design verification tools. <br> Fuzzing is
increasingly the technique of choice for discovering software
vulnerabilities, but the same cannot be said about fuzzing for hardware
designs vulnerabilities. Due to the data-flow nature of how hardware is
designed, existing software fuzzing solutions cannot be readily applied in
the hardware context, and the performance of the proposed hardware fuzzing
solutions suffers from state explosion when applied on complex hardware
designs. <br> In this work, we present BugsBunny, a feedback-guided
directed hardware-design fuzzer which aims to reduce the costs of
pre-silicon validation. BugsBunny focusses the testing resources only on
the relevant parts of the design-under-test (DUT), by fuzzing towards a
certain target state of the DUT and eliminating irrelevant parts of the
design. We propose a novel distance-to-target feedback metric, capable of
directing and guiding the fuzzer towards the desired target state, which is
based on lightweight data-flow analysis and instrumentation of the DUT. By
running the DUT on an FPGA, BugsBunny achieves high fuzzing throughput,
outperforming existing simulation-based solutions. <br> We perform an
end-to-end evaluation of BugsBunny on complex SoC designs (e.g., the RISC-V
BOOM), where preliminary experiments demonstrate a significant reduction in
the number of fuzzing seeds that are required before the DUT reaches the
target state. <br><br>

<h3 id="ekberg">Invited Talk: Hardware-assisted memory protection</h3>

<b>Speaker:</b> Dr. Jan-Erik Ekberg (Huawei) <br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b> Contemporary and soon-to emerge commercial processors
carry architectural features that, when used, allows for authentication of
register content when such are stored in memory, memory tagging (or
coloring) so that mutually exclusive memory domains at a high resolution
can be set up. Flow-control features such as shadow stacks and
branch-target protections complete the picture.  My talk will be about
recent and ongoing research where we leverage these features in the
compiler pipeline or by software design -- providing solutions for
call-flow integrity and data safety for both user-space programs and code
at higher privilege levels. My intent is to provide a panorama and share
insight into how these features can be leveraged for security, as well as
to shed light on the functional and performance cost of doing so. <br><br>

<b>Speaker's Bio:</b> Dr. Jan-Erik Ekberg has worked in the telecom
industry with the topic of securing mobile and embedded devices for 20+
years. He has participated in security standardization (Mobile TPM, WLAN,
BT, BLE security, GP TEE standards) and he is the holder of 80+ patent
families in the field of trusted execution environments, secure enclaves,
smart cards etc.  Jan-Erik's current affiliation is Head of Helsinki System
Security Laboratory in Huawei, Finland, but he also serves as adjunct
professor in Computer Science (Security) in his alma mater, Aalto
University. One of Jan-Erik's recent research interests is on
hardware-assisted memory protection technologies, and how these are
efficiently used to mitigate attacks in contemporary computing devices.

<h3 id="beerr">BEERR: Bench of Embedded system Experiments for Reproducible
Research</h3>

<b>Authors:</b> Paul Olivier, Huy Ngo Xuan and
Aurélien Francillon <br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b> Reproducing experiments is a key component to further
research and knowledge. Testbeds provide a controlled and configurable
environment in which experiments can be conducted in a repeatable and
observable manner. In the field of system security, and binary analysis,
several challenges hinder reproducible research, in particular when code is
interacting tightly with low level hardware and physical devices. In those
conditions, dynamic analysis techniques often require the physical device
to correctly complete (hardware-in-the-loop). In recent years many
re-hosting techniques have been developed and evaluating their respective
performance requires to compare them with an hardware-in-the-loop
evaluation. However, it is challenging to share, acquire or maintain the
original devices. <br> In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a
new infrastructure, and online service called &quot;Bench of Embedded
system Experiments for Reproducible Research&quot; (BEERR). It aims to both
make physical devices available remotely and facilitate the setup and
reproduction of published experiments. <br><br>
