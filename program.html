<h3 id="brent">Invited Talk: The Case for System Integrity Monitors based
on A Hardware Memory Snooper</h3>

<b>Speaker:</b> Prof. Brent Byunghoon Kang (<a
href="https://cysec.kr/">KAIST</a>) <br>
Graduate School of Information Security, School of Computing at KAIST
<br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b> The advanced malware binaries have shown great
sophistication in compromising system kernel, persisting their attacks
against the host system without being detected. To counter this serious
threat, our team has been working on creating a series of system integrity
monitors based on snooping on the kernel activities with no performance
hits on the host system. <br> I will introduce our first prototype, called
Vigilare, a kernel integrity monitor architected to snoop on the bus
traffic of the host system from separate independent hardware. This
snoop-based monitoring of Vigilare overcomes the limitations of the
previous snapshot-based monitoring solutions that cannot detect transient
attacks that occur in between snapshots. Vigilare snoops the bus traffic on
the host and can catch all the transient attacks with no performance
degradation. In contrast, the snapshot-based monitor could not detect all
the attacks and induced considerable performance degradation. <br> I will
further describe KI-Mon as our next effort to protect dynamic kernel
regions. Monitoring dynamic data structures manipulated by modern advanced
rootkits has been considered a complex and challenging problem as they are
frequently and constantly modified during normal operations of the kernel.
I will present how we addressed the challenges in tracking mutable data
objects by creating an advanced snooper module with a white-listed values
filter that can also provide on-demand verification of related data
structures to assure the semantic invariants of dynamic data structures.
<br> Finally, I will present an “Address Translation Redirection Attack”
(ATRA)” that may allow an attacker to evade all the existing hardware-based
monitors. ATRA exploits the memory management subsystem required for
translating the virtual address space in which all the programs execute
into the physical address space that the actual machine hardware operates
on. This work motivated the importance of hardening the memory translation
mechanism to ensure robust hardware-based kernel integrity monitors.

<h3 id="bugsbunny">BugsBunny: Hopping to RTL Targets with a Directed
Hardware-Design Fuzzer</h3>

<b>Authors:</b> Hany Ragab, Koen Koning, Cristiano Giuffrida and Herbert
Bos <br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b> Recent attacks on modern processors have demonstrated the
severe consequences of discovering and exploiting hardware vulnerabilities.
Simultaneously, the increasing complexity of modern chip designs and the
ever-limited testing time presents numerous challenges to existing
pre-silicon hardware-design verification tools. <br> Fuzzing is
increasingly the technique of choice for discovering software
vulnerabilities, but the same cannot be said about fuzzing for hardware
designs vulnerabilities. Due to the data-flow nature of how hardware is
designed, existing software fuzzing solutions cannot be readily applied in
the hardware context, and the performance of the proposed hardware fuzzing
solutions suffers from state explosion when applied on complex hardware
designs. <br> In this work, we present BugsBunny, a feedback-guided
directed hardware-design fuzzer which aims to reduce the costs of
pre-silicon validation. BugsBunny focusses the testing resources only on
the relevant parts of the design-under-test (DUT), by fuzzing towards a
certain target state of the DUT and eliminating irrelevant parts of the
design. We propose a novel distance-to-target feedback metric, capable of
directing and guiding the fuzzer towards the desired target state, which is
based on lightweight data-flow analysis and instrumentation of the DUT. By
running the DUT on an FPGA, BugsBunny achieves high fuzzing throughput,
outperforming existing simulation-based solutions. <br> We perform an
end-to-end evaluation of BugsBunny on complex SoC designs (e.g., the RISC-V
BOOM), where preliminary experiments demonstrate a significant reduction in
the number of fuzzing seeds that are required before the DUT reaches the
target state. <br><br>

<h3 id="ekberg">Invited Talk: Hardware-assisted memory protection</h3>

<b>Speaker:</b> Dr. Jan-Erik Ekberg (Huawei) <br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b> Contemporary and soon-to emerge commercial processors
carry architectural features that, when used, allows for authentication of
register content when such are stored in memory, memory tagging (or
coloring) so that mutually exclusive memory domains at a high resolution
can be set up. Flow-control features such as shadow stacks and
branch-target protections complete the picture.  My talk will be about
recent and ongoing research where we leverage these features in the
compiler pipeline or by software design -- providing solutions for
call-flow integrity and data safety for both user-space programs and code
at higher privilege levels. My intent is to provide a panorama and share
insight into how these features can be leveraged for security, as well as
to shed light on the functional and performance cost of doing so. <br><br>

<b>Speaker's Bio:</b> Dr. Jan-Erik Ekberg has worked in the telecom
industry with the topic of securing mobile and embedded devices for 20+
years. He has participated in security standardization (Mobile TPM, WLAN,
BT, BLE security, GP TEE standards) and he is the holder of 80+ patent
families in the field of trusted execution environments, secure enclaves,
smart cards etc.  Jan-Erik's current affiliation is Head of Helsinki System
Security Laboratory in Huawei, Finland, but he also serves as adjunct
professor in Computer Science (Security) in his alma mater, Aalto
University. One of Jan-Erik's recent research interests is on
hardware-assisted memory protection technologies, and how these are
efficiently used to mitigate attacks in contemporary computing devices.

<h3 id="marco">Invited Talk: Principled foundations for microarchitectural security</h3>

<b>Speaker:</b> Prof. Marco Guarnieri (IMDEA)
<br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b> Microarchitectural attacks, such as Spectre and Meltdown,
illustrate that artifacts of hardware implementations (like speculative and
out-of-order execution) can result in measurable side-effects on program
execution time that attackers can exploit to compromise a system’s
security. These attacks arise from emerging behaviors obtained when
combining hardware and software.  Building systems that are resistant
against these attacks requires fundamentally rethinking the design of
existing security mechanisms. <br> In this talk, I will focus on
speculative execution attacks--a specific class of microarchitectural
attacks--and I will illustrate a principled approach for reasoning about
security against these attacks. The key component of this approach is a
<i>hardware-software contract</i>, a formal ISA-level specification of the
information that may be leaked through microarchitectural side-effects.
Concretely, I will present (1) how to model the information flows at the
core of Spectre-style attacks, (2) how to formalize hardware-software
contracts, (3) how to use contracts to reason about the security of
hardware and software.  <br><br>

<b>Speaker's Bio:</b> Marco Guarnieri is an assistant professor at the
IMDEA Software Institute. Before that, he completed a Ph.D. at the
Institute of Information Security at ETH Zurich. <br> His research focuses
on the design, analysis, and implementation of practical systems for
securely storing and processing sensitive data. He applies his research to
the analysis of micro-architectural side-channel attacks (and
countermeasures) and to database security.  <br><br>

<h3 id="shadowstack">Work in progress: A formally verified shadow stack for RISC-V</h3>

<b>Authors:</b> Matthieu Baty, Guillaume Hiet and Pierre Wilke<br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b> In recent years, the disclosure of several significant
security vulnerabilities such as Spectre and Meltdown has revealed the
trust put in some presumed security properties of commonplace hardware to
be misplaced. A way of rebuilding this trust would be to make these
security properties explicit and offer corresponding computer-checked
proofs. <br> Formally proving security properties about hardware systems
might seem prohibitively complex and expensive.  This paper addresses this
concern by describing a realistic and accessible methodology for specifying
and proving security properties during hardware development. We describe
the formal specification and implementation of a shadow stack mechanism on
an RV32I processor. Our final objective would be to prove that this
security mechanism is correct, i.e., any illegal modification of a return
address does indeed result in the termination of the whole system.

<h3 id="beerr">BEERR: Bench of Embedded system Experiments for Reproducible
Research</h3>

<b>Authors:</b> Paul Olivier, Huy Ngo Xuan and
Aurélien Francillon <br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b> Reproducing experiments is a key component to further
research and knowledge. Testbeds provide a controlled and configurable
environment in which experiments can be conducted in a repeatable and
observable manner. In the field of system security, and binary analysis,
several challenges hinder reproducible research, in particular when code is
interacting tightly with low level hardware and physical devices. In those
conditions, dynamic analysis techniques often require the physical device
to correctly complete (hardware-in-the-loop). In recent years many
re-hosting techniques have been developed and evaluating their respective
performance requires to compare them with an hardware-in-the-loop
evaluation. However, it is challenging to share, acquire or maintain the
original devices. <br> In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a
new infrastructure, and online service called &quot;Bench of Embedded
system Experiments for Reproducible Research&quot; (BEERR). It aims to both
make physical devices available remotely and facilitate the setup and
reproduction of published experiments. <br><br>

<h3 id="archanaa">Invited Talk: Configuring Security for Intermittent Computing</h3>

<b>Speaker:</b> Dr. Archanaa Krishnan (Texas Instruments)
<br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b> Intermittent computing devices are powered by energy
harvested from ambient sources. They are ideal as edge devices in several
applications, such as medical implants, energy meters, and the outer space,
because of their energy autonomous operation. The security for intermittent
computing lies at the intersection of the world of intermittent computing
and the world of secure embedded devices. This talk will provide an
introduction on the what, when, why, and how to secure an embedded device
at the intersection of these two worlds. It will provide several design
factors between the two worlds that affect the net performance of secure
intermittent systems. It will also provide insight into combining key
software and hardware concepts towards designing a secure intermittent
system.  <br><br>

<b>Speaker's Bio:</b> Archanaa S. Krishnan is working at Texas Instruments'
Software R&amp;D team designing and implementing security features for wireless
connectivity devices including the security for Texas Instruments' Wireless
Battery Management Protocol. She received her Ph.D. in Computer Engineering
from the Secure Embedded Systems Lab, Virginia Tech. During her Ph.D., she
was a visiting scholar at the Vernam Lab in Worcester Polytechnique
Institute in 2020-21. She also obtained her M.S. in Computer Engineering
from Virginia Tech and B. Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering
from Vellore Institute of Technology.  <br><br>
