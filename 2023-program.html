<h3 id="constrained">A Hybrid Solution for Constraint Devices to Detect Microarchitectural Attacks</h3>

<b>Authors:</b> Nikolaos Foivos Polychronou, Pierre-Henri Thevenon, Maxime Puys and Vincent Beroulle <br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b> We are seeing an increase in cybersecurity attacks
on resource-constrained systems such as the Internet of
Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT (I-IoT) devices. Recently,
a new category of attacks has emerged called microarchitectural
attacks. It targets hardware units of the system such
as the processor or memory and is often complicated if
not impossible to remediate since it imposes modifying the
hardware. In default of remediation, some solutions propose
to detect these attacks. Yet, most of them are not suitable for
embedded systems since they are based on complex machine
learning algorithms.
In this paper, we propose an edge-computing security
solution for attack detection that uses a local-remote machine
learning implementation to find an equilibrium between
accuracy and decision-making latency while addressing the
memory, performance, and communication bandwidth constraints
of resource-constrained systems. We demonstrate
effectiveness in the detection of multiple microarchitectural
attacks such as Rowhammer or cache attacks on an embedded
device with an accuracy of 98.75% and a FPR near
0%. To limit the overhead on the communication bus, the
proposed solution allows to locally classify as trusted 99%
of the samples during normal operation and thus filtering
them out. <br><br>

<b>Authors:</b> Jean-Loup Hatchikian-Houdot, Nicolas Gaudin, Pascal Cotret, Frédéric Besson, Guy Gogniat, Guillaume Hiet, Vianney Lapôtre and Pierre Wilke <br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b> Timing side-channels are an identified threat for
security critical software. Existing countermeasures have a
cost either on the hardware requirements or execution time.
We focus on low-cost microcontrollers that have a very low
computational capacity. Although these processors do not
feature out-of-order execution or speculation, they remain
vulnerable to timing attacks exploiting the varying latencies
of ALU operations or memory accesses.
We propose to augment the RISC-V ISA with security
primitives that have a guaranteed timing behavior. These
primitives allow constant time ALU operations and memory
accesses that do not alter the state of the cache. Our ap-
proach has a low overhead in terms of hardware cost, binary
code size, and execution time both for the constant time
secure program and other programs running concurrently
on the same hardware. <br><br>

<h3 id="gem5"> Emulating Side Channel Attacks on gem5: Lessons learned </h3>

<b>Authors:</b> Lilian Bossuet, Vincent Grosso and Carlos Andres Lara Nino  <br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b> Side channel attacks (SCA) have the potential of
disrupting the trust of the users on computing platforms
and cryptographic algorithms. The main challenge in the
design of countermeasures against such threats is that an
evaluation of their effectiveness can only be performed
after they have been implemented. By that point, significant
resources would have been invested in the creation of a
prototype. Moreover, the large volume of combinations from
all the potential target algorithms and computing systems
complicates a systematical analysis. It is necessary to find
strategies to simplify and systematize the study of SCAs and
their countermeasures. gem5 is a cycle-accurate simulator
which offers the possibility to emulate a broad range of
computing architectures. Beyond the functional verification,
this tool computes multiple physical statistics from the simulated
system. In this paper, we discuss the lessons learned
from using gem5 to simulate SCAs on an ARM system. Our
work shows that while there is a correlation between the data
and the reported statistics, there are significant challenges
that must be addressed to improve the use of gem5 for the
emulation of physical phenomena. <br><br>

<h3 id="sergej">Invited Talk: Virtualization-assisted Operating System Security</h3>

<b>Speaker:</b> Sergej Proskurin <br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b> Virtualization technology has undergone a paradigm shift,
with a renewed focus on system security. This shift inspired researches to
repurpose modern virtualization extensions to form novel
virtualization-assisted primitives for dynamic binary analysis and
operating system security. This talk explores the potential of
virtualization technology for system security and how we can alleviate the
strict separation between operating systems and virtual machine monitors to
empower systems with advanced security primitives. <br><br>

<h3 id="mceliece">Faulting original McEliece’s implementations is possible -- How to mitigate this risk?</b></a><br>
  </h3>

<b>Authors:</b> Vincent Giraud and Guillaume Bouffard <br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b> Private and public actors increasingly encounter
use cases where they need to implement sensitive operations
on mass-market peripherals for which they have little or no
control. They are sometimes inclined to attempt this without
using hardware-assisted equipment, such as secure elements.
In this case, the white-box attack model is particularly
relevant and includes access to every asset, retro-engineering,
and binary instrumentation by attackers. At the same time,
quantum attacks are becoming more and more of a threat
and challenge traditional asymmetrical ciphers, which are
treasured by private and public actors.
The McEliece cryptosystem is a code-based public key
algorithm introduced in 1978 that is not subject to wellknown
quantum attacks and that could be implemented in an
uncontrolled environment. During the NIST post-quantum
cryptography standardization process [17], a derived candidate
commonly referred to as classic McEliece was selected.
This algorithm is however vulnerable to some fault injection
attacks while a priori, this does not apply to the original
McEliece. In this article, we thus focus on the original
McEliece cryptosystem and we study its resilience against
fault injection attacks on an ARM reference implementation
[18]. We disclose the first fault injection based attack
and we discuss on how to modify the original McEliece
cryptosystem to make it resilient to fault injection attacks. <br><br>

<h3 id="#socaes"> Combined Internal Attacks on SoC-FPGAs: Breaking AES with Remote Power Analysis and Frequency-based Covert Channels</h3>

<b>Authors:</b> Anis Fellah Touta, Lilian Bossuet and Carlos Andres Lara-Nino <br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b> In recent years, the field of side-channel analysis
has observed a revolution in the design of the attack
methodology. Conventional approaches which require the use
of highly specialized equipment like oscilloscopes and spectrum
analyzers, despite highly precise, might be regarded
as impractical in some scenarios. On the other hand, the
use of less-accurate internal sensors which can monitor the
power footprint of a circuit has risen in popularity. Delay
sensors have shown promising results. These structures are
interesting since they can be implemented from regular hardware
resources available in most circuits. This means that
components already available in the target platform might be
leveraged to implement a side-channel attack. Moreover, it
has been shown that is not necessary to have direct access to
the platform to carry out such an attack; which implies that
if there is a remote link such as Ethernet, an adversary might
be able to perform Remote Power Analysis (RPA) of the
system. So far, the main challenge for the success of this kind
of attack is the problem of cutting and aligning the power
traces. This is usually achieved through secondary digital
channels which carry some trigger information. In this paper,
we simplify the conditions for an RPA attack to take place.
Namely, our method mitigates the need for connecting digital
triggers to the remote sensor. We demonstrate this approach
by performing a successful key recovery on a hardware
implementation of AES <br><br>

<h3 id="acoustic">Practical Deep Learning-Based Acoustic Side Channel Attack on Keyboards</b></a><br>
  </h3>

<b>Authors:</b> Joshua Harrison, Ehsan Toreini and Maryam Mehrnezhad <br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b> With recent developments in deep learning, the
ubiquity of microphones and the rise in online services via
personal devices, acoustic side channel attacks present a
greater threat to keyboards than ever. This paper presents a
practical implementation of a state-of-the-art deep learning
model in order to classify laptop keystrokes, using a smartphone
integrated microphone. When trained on keystrokes
recorded by a nearby phone, the classifier achieved an
accuracy of 95%, the highest accuracy seen without the use
of a language model. When trained on keystrokes recorded
using the video-conferencing software Zoom, an accuracy of
93% was achieved, a new best for the medium. Our results
prove the practicality of these side channel attacks via offthe-
shelf equipment and algorithms. We discuss a series of
mitigation methods to protect users against these series of
attacks.<br><br>

<b>Authors:</b> Fatih Durmaz, Nureddin Kamadan, Melih Taha Öz, Musa Unal, Arsalan Javeed, Cemal Yilmaz and Erkay Savas <br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b> We present a static analysis approach to detect
malicious binaries that are capable of carrying out a timing
attack. The proposed approach is based on a simple
observation that the timing attacks typically operate by
measuring the execution times of short sequences of instructions.
Consequently, given a binary, we first construct
the control flow graph of the binary and then determine
the paths between the pairs of time readings, on which a
suspiciously low number of instructions might be executed.
In the presence of such a path, we mark the binary as
potentially malicious and report all the suspicious paths
identified. In the experiments, where a collection of benign
and malicious binaries were used, the proposed approach
correctly detected all the malicious binaries with an accuracy
up to 99.5% and without any false negatives. <br><br>

<h3 id="spection"> Conception and implementation of a language dedicated to virtual machine introspection</h3>

<b>Authors:</b> Lionel Hemmerlé, Jean-Christophe Prévotet, Guillaume Hiet, Frédéric Tronel and Pierre Wilke <br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b> When using a Host-based Intrusion Detection System
(HIDS), we need to protect it against attackers who
manage to access a high privilege level. For that, we propose
to use virtualization extensions: the protected system can be
placed inside a Virtual Machine (VM) and the HIDS in
the hypervisor. In this case, even if the VM containing the
protected system is entirely compromised by an attacker,
including the virtualized operating system, the IDS will still
be functional. However, when the HIDS is located in the
hypervisor, although it can access the VM memory and
intercept all its communication with the hardware, it loses all
the abstractions given by the virtualized operating system. To
cross this semantic gap, we propose to create a new language
that can be used by the VM to write and send programs to
the hypervisor. Being produced by the virtual machine itself,
we assume that these programs will have the necessary level
of knowledge about the depths of the operating system used
by the virtual machine. The hypervisor will process those
programs and interpret them to detect intrusions.
Besides, since those programs came from an untrusted
source (the VM) and are executed in the hypervisor, we
discuss some security constraints that must be enforced
by our solution to ensure that it does not introduce new
vulnerabilities in the hypervisor.
We already implemented two kernel rootkits that can
hide a process from the userspace in the VM, and we created
a detection mechanism that receives from a VM a list of
memory areas that must be monitored by the hypervisor to
detect the two rootkits that we have implemented. <br><br>
